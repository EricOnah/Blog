To render the contents of the post array, you use a forEach loop in the ejs.
The tag for this process is what is tricky. You use a scriplet tag (<% %>) for the forEach loop.
In the code block of the forEach loop you render the required html using <%= %> tag inside the html tag as
html tags should not be nested inside an ejs tag.

To position the footer at the bottom of the page and have show up only when you scroll to the bottom using
flex-box - you set the body display to flex and give a min-height of 100v and flex-direction to column.
Then give the body main content a flex: 1 value to push the footer to th bottom of the page.
