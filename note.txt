To render the contents of the post array, you use a forEach loop in the ejs.
The tag for this process is what is tricky. You use a scriplet tag (<% %>) for the forEach loop.
In the code block of the forEach loop you render the required html using <%= %> tag inside the html tag as
html tags should not be nested inside an ejs tag.

To position the footer at the bottom of the page and have show up only when you scroll to the bottom using
flex-box - you set the body display to flex and give a min-height of 100v and flex-direction to column.
Then give the body main content a flex: 1 value to push the footer to th bottom of the page.

lodash is a utility you can use to convert url parameters to lowercase so that you can match with the title of
the post in the array or database.
To import lodash after installing with npm you use <import _ from "lodash">
To use in your code - _.kebabCase(string).replace(/-/g, '') this remove all the spaces and special character from
the string and also return the string in lowercase

You can also do the above with plain JS - string.toLowerCase().replace(/[^a-z0-9]/g, ''); This is preferred for
performance reasons.

After adding the single post page and route, custom css failed to load on the single post page due to error in path
to solve this I linked to the css again using a path that will be correct when we are on the post page -
<<link rel="stylesheet" href="../css/styles.css">>

When using .env file to store your database connection string, you should configure dotenv <dotenv.cong()> before declaring the
connection variables

await MyModel.find({}); await MyModel.find({ name: 'john', age: { $gte: 18 } }).exec(); returns a promise so you need
a .then(()=>{}) to get to the data returned.

to update the content in the database you can use an async function like 

    const filter = { _id: id };
    const options = { upsert: true };
    const newValues = {
        $set: { title: `${updatedTitle}`, content: `${updatedContent}` },
      };
    const result = await Post.updateOne(filter, newValues, options);
